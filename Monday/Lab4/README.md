# Lab 4 - Change VM size, resize the OS disk, add a data disk

Create a new Windows VM. Use the code samples in VMScaling-Example.ps1 to do the following:

* Scale up to a larger VM size
* Resize the OS disk on your VM
* Add an SSD disk to your VM
* When complete, either power off your VM or delete the resource groups in your Azure Pass subscription. You'll need a VM for the next lab, so if you want you can just power off your VM.
