# Lab1 - Configure Your Azure Cloud Shell

1. Launch Cloud Shell from the top navigation of the Azure portal (select bash)
2. Select "Create storage" to create a storage account and Azure file share
3. Run "az account list" to view your subscription details
4. Persist data to your cloud shell. Create a text file (you can drag and drop) in /home/username/ and make sure that you can see it in the file share in your cloud shell storage account
5. Bonus: Execute the shell script in this repo inside your cloud shell to view a list of regions available to your Azure subscription.
