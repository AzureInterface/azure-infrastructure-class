# Lab1 - Installing Azure tools and Github for Windows

* Use the Web Platform installer to install Microsoft Azure PowerShell
* Install Github for Windows (we'll need the Git Shell later). You can also and clone the AzureInterface repository if you want a local copy of the repo.
* Initialize Azure RM PowerShell. Make sure you can use the Login-AzureRmAccount cmdlet with your Azure Pass.
