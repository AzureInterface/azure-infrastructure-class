# Lab1 - Installing Azure tools and Github for Windows

* Install Microsoft Azure PowerShell (Install-Module AzureRM)
* Initialize Azure RM PowerShell and make sure you can use the Login-AzureRmAccount cmdlet with your Azure Pass.
* Install Github for Windows (we'll need the Git Shell later). You can also and clone the AzureInterface repository if you want a local copy of the repo.
