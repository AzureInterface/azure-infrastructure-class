# Lab 1 - Azure Automation: Runbooks

* Create an automation account w/ RunAs account
* Write a runbook that will start/stop your virtual machine based on a schedule. Imagine you're building a runbook that makes sure your instances run only during business hours.
* Try invoking your runbook using a webhook from an external app (powershell, curl, etc.)
