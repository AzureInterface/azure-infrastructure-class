# Lab 1 - Azure Automation: Runbooks

* Create an automation account w/ RunAs account
* Write a runbook that will start/stop your virtual machine based on a schedule. Imagine you're building a runbook that makes sure your instances run only during business hours.
* Try invoking your runbook using a webhook from an external app (powershell, curl, etc.)
* Setup a Windows 2012 R2 VM that will act as an "on-prem" server. Set it up as a hybrid runbook worker
* See if you can run a workbook on a hybrid runbook worker
