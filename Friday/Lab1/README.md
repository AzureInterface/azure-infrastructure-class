# Lab 1 - Setup Azure Role Based Access Control

1. Create a new user account in Azure AD
2. Assign the new user Access Control (IAM) permissions to a resource of your choice in the portal (e.g. a resource group or virtual machine)
3. Using another browser instance (e.g. in-private browsing or browsing incognito) sign into the Azure portal as your new Azure AD user and verify that you can access the assigned resources
