# Lab 2 - Azure Automation: Runbooks

1. Create an automation account w/ RunAs account
2. Write a runbook that will start/stop your virtual machine based on a schedule. Imagine you're building a runbook that makes sure your instances run only during business hours.
3. Try invoking your runbook using a webhook from an external app (powershell, curl, etc.)
