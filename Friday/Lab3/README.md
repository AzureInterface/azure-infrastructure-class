# Lab 3 - Azure Automation: DSC

1. Create a DSC configuration in your Automation account
2. Complile your DSC configuration to a node configuration
3. On-board a DSC node in your Automation account
4. Associate your node configuration with your DSC node
5. Verify that the DSC node applies the configuration

Note: You can use the advm.ps1 configuration as an example. Just rename the file and the config to the name of your server. For example, if the server name is SRV1, change the filename to SRV1.ps1 and replace "advm" in the configuration script.
